The 2014 CPS ASEC (which refers to health insurance coverage estimates of the calendar year 2013) is the first to use the redesigned  measures of health insurance coverage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Following more than a decade of research, evaluation, and consultation with outside experts, the Census Bureau implemented an approach shown to improve the accuracy of health insurance coverage measurement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to these changes, data for the 2014 CPS ASEC are not comparable to data from earlier years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Inferences should be made with extreme caution when the cell sizes are small. To examine cell sizes, select  ""Display Unweighted Record Counts"" under the Statistics Option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some CPS questions, such as income, ask about the previous year. Others, such as age, refer to the time of the survey. The column labels indicate any subject with a reference year which differs from the survey year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
